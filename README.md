# Package Orchestration Server

This code was originally part of the [kpt](https://github.com/kptdev/kpt)
project, but that project has decided to donate the code to Nephio as of
December 2023.

Package Orchestration Server (a.k.a. Porch) is a k8s extension apiserver
which manages the lifecycle of KRM configuration packages.
